# Course Information
## Credit
3-0-0 (L-T-P)

## Background Knowledge
A thorough knowledge of **C programming** is a hard prerequisite of this course, which presumably you have due to PDS. While we aim to make this course “self contained” in terms of the background knowledge required, your mileage (and thus time needed to be spent) will be improved if you are familiar with the following (not exhaustive) topics:

*   Python
*   Assembly programming
*   Web programming
*   Unix (Linux, BSD, …)
*   Computer Architecture

## Lectures
Scheduled lecture timings are:

*   Wednesday 10:00 am - 10:55 am
*   Thursday 9:00 am - 9:55 am
*   Friday 11:00 am - 11:55 am

In this semester we will conduct the course offline with a mix of live lectures, and pre-recorded course videos (if necessary).

## Textbook

There are no specified textbooks. Required readings and study resources will be shared in the [schedule](/InfoSec-2025/schedule) and in [MS Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app). Moreover, we will post interesting readings on the [readings](/InfoSec-2025/readings) tab.

## Coursework

The coursework for all students consists of two tests and several assignments (in groups of an appropriate size).

## Communication

We will update the schedule, readings and MS-Teams regularly throughout the course.

### Joining MS Teams

Note that you NEED TO join the Microsoft teams classroom titled *“Information and Systems Security 2025 (CS60112)”* for this course. We will also share the recordings (as well as recorded lectures) of the lectures via Microsoft Teams. Drop the instructors an email ASAP if you cannot access the Microsoft teams classroom.

We would announce doubt clearing sessions to complement the lecture sessions as we go. Please keep an eye on the schedule and MS Teams channels.

### General discussion

We’ll use MS Teams for general discussion and questions about course material.

You should already have the account username and password to log into Microsoft teams. If you cannot access the Microsoft teams classroom titled *“Information and Systems Security 2024 (CS60112)”* please let the instructors know as soon as possible.

If you need to reach out to the instructors (e.g., pertaining to an illness or other events that might be impacting your performance in class), please send a private chat on MS Teams visible only to the instructors. Please use the Microsoft teams chatroom (and channels) to discuss publicly with your peers in real-time.

Please try to keep all course-related communication to MS Teams rather than email.

## Late Policy

You need to strictly adhere to the deadlines for the submissions (e.g., reports, test scripts etc.) announced for this course in MS teams, or by design Moodle will not accept it.

Of course, in exceptional circumstances related to personal emergencies, serious illness, wellness concerns, family emergencies, and similar, please make the course staff aware of your situation beforehand/as soon as possible and we will decide how to handle your case.

# Course Evaluation (Tentative)
## Mid and End Sem (55%)

To test student’s understanding we will conduct mid/end semester examination as per institute regulations. We will share the details in due course.

## Assignments (45%)

You will have several assignments, which will need to be submitted as a group (of appropriate size).

# Honour code

You are permitted to talk to the course staff and to your fellow students about any of the problem sets. Any assistance, though, must be limited to discussion of the problem and sketching general approaches to a solution. Each student must write out his or her own solutions to the problem sets. Consulting another student’s solution is prohibited, and submitted solutions may not be copied from any source. These and any other form of collaboration on assignments constitute cheating.

No collaboration is permitted on quizzes or assignments. All work submitted for the project must properly cite ideas and work that are not those of the students in the group. <u> Simply stated, feel free to discuss problems with each other, but do not cheat. It is not worth it, and you will get caught. In that case, we will be forced to award you no marks for that assignment/quiz/project, take away 50% of your total final marks and you will risk de-registration.</u>

# Grading (Tentative)

Your course grading will be calculated as follows:

*   Mid and End Sem: 55%
*   Assignments: 45%

# Wellness

If a personal emergency comes up that might impact your work in the class, please let the instructors know via a private chat message (to all the course instructors) so that the course staff can make appropriate arrangements. We are going through unprecedented times and circumstances can sometimes be very overwhelming, and all of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone.
